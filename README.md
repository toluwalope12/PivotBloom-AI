# PivotBloom: Executive Career Reasoning Engine
PivotBloom is a high-fidelity career transition platform that serves as a Strategic Architect and Multimodal Auditor for leaders navigating industry pivots. Built entirely within Google AI Studio, it leverages a sophisticated dual-model architecture to bridge the gap between abstract strategy and real-world performance.

## 🚀 The "Gemini Sandwich" Architecture
To balance deep reasoning with real-time responsiveness, PivotBloom utilizes a "Gemini Sandwich" approach:

Gemini 3 Pro (The Brain): Handles deep-reasoning tasks, including extracting "unique edges" from user history and synthesizing complex, JSON-based strategic roadmaps.

Gemini 3 Flash (The Reflex): Powers the Multimodal Simulator, providing low-latency audio transcription and real-time behavioral auditing of executive presence.

## ✨ Key Features
### 1. The Intelligence Terminal (Coach)
A deep-reasoning dialogue space where the Strategic Coach identifies a user's "unfair advantage" in a new market.

Persona-Driven: Moves away from generic AI to a targeted executive mentor experience.

Context-Aware: Remembers multi-turn conversations to build a cohesive career narrative.

### 2. Visual Trajectory (Roadmap)

### 3. Multimodal Simulator (The Auditor)
A live practice environment with a built-in AI Auditor.

Presence Benchmarking: Monitors composure, confidence, and word choice in real-time.
